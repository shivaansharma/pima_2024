name ->Analyze Important Features of PIMA Indian Database
For Diabetes Prediction Using KNN

ABSTRACT->

Some machine learning research has used data from the PIDD (PIMA
Indian Diabetes Dataset) to predict diabetes. In this research, in
addition to prediction accuracy, data complexity is also important.
This research analyzes important features in the PIMA Indian
database using the KNN (k-nearest neighbor) method for
classification. The results show that using KNN with k=22 value
results in the highest accuracy of 83.12%. The analysis also found
that the important features required by the KNN method to
achieve high accuracy from the PIMA Indian database, in order
of importance, are glucose, age, insulin, blood pressure, Body Mass
Index, pregnancy, skin thickness, and diabetes pedigree function.
However, when used in the KNN classification method, the
diabetes pedigree function feature was found to be unnecessary,
not relevant, and can be reduced.

PAPER : 3
name -> A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF DIABETES DETECTION USING THE PIMA
INDIAN DIABETES DATABASE

ABSTRACT->

The accurate detection of diabetes plays a critical role in early intervention and effective management
of the disease. In recent years, deep learning models have shown great potential in medical diagnosis
tasks, including diabetes detection. This paper presents a comparative study of three popular models -
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -
for diabetes detection on the widely used Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The study aims to evaluate the
performance of these models using common evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-
score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The dataset is
preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and split into training and testing sets. Each
model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. The results of the study show that the
LSTM model achieves the highest performance across all metrics. It demonstrates the ability to capture
the temporal nature of the dataset and extract meaningful patterns for accurate diabetes detection. RF
and CNN models also exhibit promising performance but slightly lower metrics compared to LSTM. In
the comparative analysis, the strengths and weaknesses of each model are discussed. LSTM, as a
recurrent neural network, excels in capturing temporal dependencies, while RF offers simplicity and
interpretability. CNN, although originally designed for image analysis, shows potential when adapted to
tabular data. The findings of this study have implications for healthcare practitioners and researchers
working on diabetes detection. The LSTM model achieves its highest accuracy at 85%, demonstrating its
effectiveness as an accurate method for predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database
(PIDD). However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the study, such as the relatively small
dataset size and potential class imbalance in the dataset. Future research can address these limitations and
further investigate the application of deep learning models in diabetes detection.

name -> Genetic algorithm based feature selection and MOE Fuzzy classification
algorithm on Pima Indians Diabetes dataset

ABSTRACT->

Diabetes Mellitus is a dreadful disease
characterized by increased levels of glucose in the blood, termed
as the condition of hyperglycemia. As this disease is prominent
among the tropical countries like India, an intense research is
being carried out to deliver a machine learning model that could
learn from previous patient records in order to deliver smart
diagnosis. This research work aims to improve the accuracy of
existing diagnostic methods for the prediction of Type 2 Diabetes
with machine learning algorithms. The proposed algorithm
selects the essential features from the Pima Indians Diabetes
Dataset with Goldberg’s Genetic algorithm in the pre-processing
stage and a Multi Objective Evolutionary Fuzzy Classifier is
applied on the dataset. This algorithm works on the principle of
maximum classifier rate and minimum rules. As a result of
feature selection with GA the number of features is reduced to 4
from 8 and the classifier rate is improved to 83.0435 % with
NSGA II in training rate of 70% and 30% testing.

name -> Prediction of the Onset of Diabetes Using Artificial Neural Network and Pima
Indians Diabetes Dataset

ABSTRACT->

When a human body unable to respond to the
insulin properly and/or unable to produce the required amount
of insulin to regulate glucose, it means that the human body is
suffering from Diabetes. Diabetes increases the risk of developing
another disease like heart disease, kidney disease, and damage
to blood vessels, nerve damage, and blindness. The diagnosis of
diabetes using proper analysis of diabetes data is a significant
problem. In this paper, an automatic diagnosis system is intro-
duced and analyzed. For this purpose, a Three-Layered Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) and Pima Indians Diabetes dataset are
used. In this ANN based prediction model, a logistic-activation-
function for activation of neurons, and the Quasi Newton method
is used as the algorithm for the training. As a result cumulative
gain plot and as a measure of the quality of this model the
maximum gain score is used.

name -> Application of Genetic Algorithm Optimized Neural Network Connection
Weights for Medical Diagnosis of PIMA Indians Diabetes

ABSTRACT->

Neural Networks are one of many data mining analytical tools that can be utilized to make predictions for
medical data. Model selection for a neural network entails various factors such as selection of the optimal
number of hidden nodes, selection of the relevant input variables and selection of optimal connection
weights. This paper presents the application of hybrid model that integrates Genetic Algorithm and Back
Propatation network(BPN) where GA is used to initialize and optmize the connection weights of BPN .
Significant feactures identified by using two methods :Decision tree and GA-CFS method are used as
input to the hybrid model to diagonise diabetes mellitus. The results prove that, GA-optimized BPN
approach has outperformed the BPN approach without GA optimization. In addition the hybrid GA-BPN
with relevant inputs lead to further improvised categorization accuracy compared to results produced by
GA-BPN alone with some redundant inputs.

PAPER : 8
name -> A New Method of Data Preparation for
Classifying Diabetes Dataset

ABSTRACT ->

Method: Data preprocessing is an
important step in building classification models. Pima Indian Diabetes dataset from University of California Irvine (UCI)
repository is a challenging dataset with more number (48%) of missing values. Different steps of data preprocessing is
performed on Pima Diabetes to improve the accuracy of the classification model. The proposed model includes outlier
removal and imputation at stage 1, normalization at stage 2 and balancing the dataset at stage 3. After each stage of
preprocessing, the model is evaluated using three classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and
K-nearest neighbor (Knn). Findings: It is clearly proved that after each stage of preprocessing, the classification accuracy
increases. On completing all 3 stages of preprocessing, the diabetes dataset achieves a highest accuracy (82.14%) and
balanced accuracy (81.94%) with Random Forest classifier when compared to SVM and Knn. Novelty/Improvements:
The preprocessing steps, replacing the outliers using 5 and 95 percentile values with median imputation followed by
Z-score normalization and balancing the dataset using smote improves the quality of Pima Diabetes dataset, thereby
classification accuracy of the model increases. The same data preprocessing methods can also be applied to different
datasets or different classifier models.

name ->A New Classwise k Nearest Neighbor (CKNN)
Method for the Classification of Diabetes
Dataset

ABSTRACT->

The general problem for data quality is missing data.
The real datasets have lot of missing values. Mean method of
imputation is the most common method to replace the missing
values. In our previous work [23], we address the negative impact
of missing value imputation and solution for improvement while
evaluating the performance of kNN algorithm for classification of
Diabetes data. In this paper, we address a new Class-wise k
Nearest Neighbor (CkNN) method for the Classification of
Diabetes Dataset. We selected diabetes dataset because it contains
lot of missing values and the impact of imputation is very obvious.
To measure the performance, we used Accuracy, Sensitivity and
Specificity and Error rate as the metrics. The arrived results show
the significant improvement measured with respect to the above
metrics.

PAPER : 11
name -> Diabetes prediction using machine learning and explainable AI
techniques

ABSTRACT ->

Globally, diabetes affects 537 million people, making it the deadliest and the most common
non-communicable disease. Many factors can cause a person to get affected by diabetes,
like excessive body weight, abnormal cholesterol level, family history, physical inactivity,
bad food habit etc. Increased urination is one of the most common symptoms of this
disease. People with diabetes for a long time can get several complications like heart dis-
order, kidney disease, nerve damage, diabetic retinopathy etc. But its risk can be reduced
if it is predicted early. In this paper, an automatic diabetes prediction system has been
developed using a private dataset of female patients in Bangladesh and various machine
learning techniques. The authors used the Pima Indian diabetes dataset and collected addi-
tional samples from 203 individuals from a local textile factory in Bangladesh. Feature
selection algorithm mutual information has been applied in this work. A semi-supervised
model with extreme gradient boosting has been utilized to predict the insulin features of
the private dataset. SMOTE and ADASYN approaches have been employed to manage the
class imbalance problem. The authors used machine learning classification methods, that
is, decision tree, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and various ensem-
ble techniques, to determine which algorithm produces the best prediction results. After
training on and testing all the classification models, the proposed system provided the
best result in the XGBoost classifier with the ADASYN approach with 81% accuracy,
0.81 F1 coefficient and AUC of 0.84. Furthermore, the domain adaptation method has
been implemented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed system. The explainable
AI approach with LIME and SHAP frameworks is implemented to understand how the
model predicts the final results. Finally, a website framework and an Android smartphone
application have been developed to input various features and predict diabetes instan-
taneously.

PAPER : 12
name -> Leveraging Pima Dataset to Diabetes Prediction:
Case Study of Deep Neural Network

ABSTRACT->

Diabetes is a chronic disease. In 2019, it was the ninth leading cause of death
with an estimated 1.5 million deaths. Poorly controlled, diabetes can lead to
serious health problems. That explains why early diagnosis of diabetes is very
important. Several approaches that use Artificial Intelligence, specifically
Deep Learning, have been widely used with promising results. The contribu-
tion of this paper is in two-folds: 1) Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach is
used on Pima Indian dataset to predict diabetes using 10 k-fold cross valida-
tion and 89% accuracy is obtained; 2) comparative analysis of previous work
is provided on diabetes prediction using DNN with the tested model. The re-
sults showed that 10 k-fold cross-validation could decrease the efficiency of
diabetes prediction models using DNN.

PAPER : 13
name -> Evolving fuzzy medical diagnosis of Pima Indians diabetes and of
dermatological diseases

ABSTRACT->

This paper reviews a methodology for evolving fuzzy classification which allows data to be
processed in online mode by recursively modifying a fuzzy rule base on a per-sample basis from data
streams. In addition, it shows how this methodology can be improved and applied to the field of
diagnostics, for two popular medical problems.
Method: The vast majority of existing methodologies for fuzzy medical diagnostics require the data
records to be processed in offline mode, as a batch. Unfortunately this allows only a snapshot of the
actual domain to be analysed. Should new data records become available they require cost sensitive
calculations due to the fact that re-learning is an iterative procedure. eClass is a relatively new
architecture for evolving fuzzy rule-based systems, which overcomes these problems. However, it is data
order dependent as different orders of the data result into different rule bases. Nonetheless, it is shown
that models of eClass can be improved by arranging the order of the incoming data using a simple
optimization strategy.
Results: In regards to the Pima Indians diabetes dataset, an accuracy of 79.37% was obtained, which is
0.84% lower than the highest in the literature. The proposed optimization strategy increased the
accuracy and specificity of the model by 4.05% and 7.63% respectively. For the dermatology dataset, an
accuracy of 97.55% was obtained, which is 1.65% lower than the highest in the literature. In this case, the
proposed optimization strategy improved the accuracy of the model by 4.82%. The improved algorithm
has been compared to other existing algorithms and seems to outperform the majority.
Conclusions: This paper has shown that eClass can effectively be applied to the classification of diabetes
and dermatological diseases from discrete numerical samples. The results of using a novel optimization
strategy indicate that the accuracy of eClass models can be further improved. Finally, the system can
mine human readable rules which could enable medical experts to gain better understanding of a sample
under analysis throughout the traditional diagnostic process.

PAPER : 14
name -> Computational Approach to Clinical Diagnosis of
Diabetes Disease: A Comparative Study

ABSTRACT ->

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases and is the 6th leading cause
of death worldwide. It’s a chronic metabolic disorder which has no cure, however, it is a highly
treatable condition, if diagnosed and managed on time to avoid its complications. This paper explores
and compares various machine learning (ML) approaches that can help in determining the risk of
diabetes at an early stage and aid in improving the medical diagnosis of diabetes. The paper considers
two real-world datasets one is a diabetic clinical dataset (DCA) collected from a medical practitioner
in the state of Assam, India during the year 2017-2018 and other is public PIMA Indian diabetic
dataset. To analyze the various machine learning techniques on DCA and PIMA Indian diabetic
datasets for the classification of diabetic and non-diabetic patients, different classifiers like perceptron,
Gaussian process, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, statistical gradient
descent, ridge regression classifier, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, naïve
Bayes, logistic regression, random forest and ELM for multiquadric, RBF, sigmoid activation functions
are used. The results of numerical experiments suggested that logistic regression yields better
performance in comparison to the other techniques.

PAPER : 15
name -> Dataset and Feature Analysis for Diabetes Mellitus
Classification using Random Forest

ABSTRACT->

Diabetes Mellitus is a hazardous disease, and according to the World Health Organization
(WHO), diabetes will be one of the main causes of death by 2030. One of the most popular diabetes
10
datasets is PIMA Indians, and this dataset has been widely tested on various machine learning (ML)
methods, even deep learning (DL). But on average, ML methods are not able to produce good accu-
racy. The quality of the dataset and features is the most influential thing in this case, so deeper invest-
ment is needed to examine this dataset. This research will analyze and compare the PIMA Indians and
Abelvikas datasets using the Random Forest (RF) method. The two datasets are imbalanced, in fact,
the Abelvikas dataset is more imbalanced and has a larger number of classes so it is be more complex.
The RF was chosen because it is one of the ML methods that has the best results on various diabetes
datasets. Based on the test results, very contrasting results were obtained on the two datasets. Abelvikas
had accuracy, precision, and recall, reaching 100%, and PIMA Indians only achieved 75% for accuracy,
87% for precision, and 80% for the best recall. Testing was done with 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 tree number
parameters. Apart from that, it was also tested with k-fold validation to get valid results. This deter-
mines that the features in the Abelvikas dataset are much better because more complete glucose fea-
tures support them.
